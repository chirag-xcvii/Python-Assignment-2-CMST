## Sorting and Searching Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations of common sorting and searching algorithms, along with code to measure and visualize their performance on different datasets.

# Overview
In this project, we have implemented the following sorting and searching algorithms:

Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
Searching Algorithms
Linear Search
Binary Search
We measure the execution time of these algorithms on datasets of varying sizes and visualize their performance using Python's Matplotlib library.

# Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need the following:

Python 3.x
Matplotlib (for generating plots)
